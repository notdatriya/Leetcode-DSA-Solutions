This is brute force method, Time complexity- O(nlogn)+O(n) Space -O(1)
Another method can be to use frequency array, iterate over the array,change frequency to one, if its already one, return the element.
Time comp= O(n)
Space comp= O(n)

Another method is to use linked list cycle method, which - youtube pe dekhna padega
