brute force and better is same as in n/2 wala solution.
​
Optimal solution- some changes in n/2 algorithm of moose voting algo
​
here there will be two counters and two elements, and all other process will be same.
additonal condition check is, if c1==0 ,so we will take another element but it should not be equal to el2 .same for c2==0;
